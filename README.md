Overview
---------------------------------------------
This study demonstrates statewide detection of Parvovirus B19 (B19V) from Texas wastewater using hybrid-capture virome sequencing across 43 sites in 15 cities. Sequencing enabled full-genome recovery and real-time tracking of outbreak-associated mutations during the 2024 surge. Wastewater signal was highly correlated with clinical trends and consistently led reported cases by one month.
